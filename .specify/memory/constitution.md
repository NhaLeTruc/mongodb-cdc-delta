# MongoDB CDC to Delta Lake Pipeline Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Tests MUST be written before implementation code.**

- Every feature begins with failing tests (Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced)
- Tests MUST be reviewed and approved by stakeholders before implementation begins
- No production code may be written without corresponding tests
- Contract tests required for all external integrations (MongoDB, Delta Lake, Kafka, MinIO)
- Integration tests required for data pipeline flows and transformations
- Unit tests required for business logic, validators, and transformation functions
- Test coverage MUST meet minimum 80% threshold for all production code

**Rationale**: TDD ensures correctness, prevents regressions, documents behavior, and enables confident refactoring in mission-critical CDC pipelines where data integrity and analytical accuracy are paramount.

### II. Clean Code & Maintainability

**Code MUST be self-documenting, simple, and maintainable.**

- Follow SOLID principles: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
- Functions MUST have single, clear purpose with descriptive names
- Maximum function complexity: McCabe complexity ≤ 10
- Maximum function length: 50 lines (excluding tests)
- No code duplication: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle enforced
- Type hints MUST be present for all function signatures (Python) or equivalent in other languages
- Code MUST pass all linting checks (Black, Ruff, mypy for Python)
- Comments explain "why", not "what" - code explains "what"
- Magic numbers replaced with named constants
- Configuration externalized (environment variables, config files)

**Rationale**: Clean code reduces cognitive load, accelerates onboarding, minimizes bugs, and ensures long-term maintainability in complex CDC systems.

### III. Robust Architecture & Design Patterns

**Architecture MUST follow proven design patterns and best practices.**

Required Patterns:
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access for MongoDB, Delta Lake, and reconciliation state storage
- **Strategy Pattern**: Support multiple CDC strategies (change streams, oplog tailing) and reconciliation modes
- **Factory Pattern**: Create appropriate handlers for different MongoDB BSON data types and Delta Lake conversions
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven pipeline stages with pub/sub messaging
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance for external service calls
- **Retry with Exponential Backoff**: Resilient error handling
- **Bulkhead**: Isolate failures to prevent cascade effects

Architecture Constraints:
- Separation of Concerns: Clear boundaries between capture, transform, load layers
- Dependency Injection: Services receive dependencies via constructors
- Interface-based Design: Depend on abstractions, not implementations
- Stateless Components: Services MUST be horizontally scalable
- Idempotent Operations: All data transformations MUST be safely retriable
- Schema Evolution: Support forward and backward compatibility

**Rationale**: Proven patterns reduce risk, improve testability, enable independent evolution of components, and ensure system reliability at enterprise scale.

### IV. Enterprise Production Readiness

**Systems MUST meet enterprise-grade production standards.**

Performance Requirements:
- Throughput: Process ≥10,000 events/second per node
- Latency: P95 end-to-end latency ≤ 2 seconds
- Scalability: Horizontal scaling to 100+ nodes supported
- Resource Limits: Memory footprint ≤ 2GB per process at 10K events/sec

Reliability Requirements:
- Availability: 99.9% uptime (≤ 8.76 hours downtime/year)
- Data Integrity: Zero data loss guarantee with exactly-once delivery semantics
- Failure Recovery: Automatic recovery from transient failures within 30 seconds
- Disaster Recovery: Full system recovery within 4 hours (RTO), data loss ≤ 5 minutes (RPO)
- Backpressure Handling: Graceful degradation under load spikes
- Dead Letter Queue: Capture and isolate unprocessable events

Operational Requirements:
- Zero-downtime deployments: Blue-green or canary deployment strategies
- Rolling updates: No service interruption during version upgrades
- Configuration hot-reload: Apply config changes without restart where feasible
- Health checks: Liveness and readiness endpoints for orchestrators
- Graceful shutdown: Complete in-flight transactions before termination

**Rationale**: Production systems require rigorous standards to meet SLAs, handle scale, recover from failures, and operate reliably 24/7.

### V. Observability & Monitoring

**All system behavior MUST be observable and measurable.**

Structured Logging:
- JSON format with consistent schema (timestamp, level, service, trace_id, message, context)
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL appropriately applied
- Correlation IDs: Track requests across all pipeline stages
- No sensitive data in logs (PII, credentials)
- Sampling for high-volume debug logs to control cost

Metrics (RED Method):
- **Rate**: Requests/events per second (throughput)
- **Errors**: Error rate by type and component
- **Duration**: Latency percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
- **Saturation**: Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Business Metrics: Records processed, lag time, backlog depth
- Custom Metrics: Schema evolution events, type conversion failures

Tracing:
- Distributed tracing for end-to-end request flows
- Span instrumentation for all major operations (read, transform, write)
- Trace sampling: 100% for errors, 1-10% for success cases

Alerting:
- SLO-based alerts: Notify when SLIs approach SLO thresholds
- Critical alerts: Data loss, system unavailability, cascading failures
- Warning alerts: High latency, elevated error rates, resource saturation
- Alert runbooks: Every alert includes diagnostic steps and remediation actions

**Rationale**: Observability enables rapid diagnosis, proactive issue detection, capacity planning, and continuous improvement of CDC pipeline reliability.

### VI. Security & Compliance

**Security MUST be built-in, not bolted-on.**

Credential Management:
- NO hardcoded credentials in code (pre-commit hook enforced)
- Secrets stored in Vault or equivalent secret management system
- Credentials rotated automatically every 90 days
- Least privilege: Services use minimal required permissions

Data Protection:
- Encryption in transit: TLS 1.3 for all network communication
- Encryption at rest: Database-level encryption for sensitive data
- PII handling: Identify, classify, and protect Personally Identifiable Information
- Data masking: Obfuscate sensitive fields in non-production environments
- Audit logging: Record all data access and modifications with immutable logs

Code Security:
- Bandit security scanning (pre-commit hook enforced)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning: Daily checks for CVEs
- Static analysis: Detect SQL injection, command injection, path traversal
- No `eval()` or `exec()` use without explicit security review

Compliance:
- GDPR: Right to erasure, data portability support where applicable
- SOC 2: Access controls, change management, incident response procedures
- Audit trail: Maintain 1-year retention of all pipeline operations

**Rationale**: Security breaches and compliance failures have catastrophic consequences. Security-first design prevents vulnerabilities and ensures regulatory compliance.

## Data Pipeline Standards

### Change Data Capture Requirements

**Capture**:
- Support MongoDB versions (3.6+ through 7.0+) with change streams
- Detect schema changes automatically (MongoDB's flexible schema)
- Handle document deletions and updates correctly
- Preserve MongoDB BSON data types including ObjectId, Date, Binary, nested documents
- Support filtering by database, collection, and field patterns
- Checkpoint progress for resumability using Kafka Connect offsets

**Transform**:
- Type mapping: MongoDB BSON → Delta Lake/Parquet type conversions
- Schema translation: MongoDB collections → Delta Lake table schemas with struct/array types
- Data normalization: Handle MongoDB nested documents and arrays appropriately
- Conflict resolution: Define strategies for concurrent updates and schema evolution
- Data validation: Ensure data quality and handle schema variations

**Load**:
- Batch writes with configurable batch size (default 1000 records)
- Upsert operations: Merge into Delta Lake based on document _id
- Transaction boundaries: Delta Lake ACID guarantees for batch writes
- Backpressure: Pause Kafka consumption when MinIO storage overloaded
- Error isolation: Failed records routed to Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) without blocking pipeline

### Performance Optimization

**Batching**:
- Micro-batching: Accumulate events for 100ms or 1000 records (whichever first)
- Adaptive batching: Adjust batch size based on throughput and latency metrics

**Parallelism**:
- Partitioned processing: Distribute work by MongoDB document _id or shard key via Kafka partitions
- Thread pools: Separate pools for I/O (unbounded) and CPU (bounded) tasks
- Async I/O: Non-blocking operations using async/await for MongoDB, MinIO, and Delta Lake writes

**Caching**:
- Schema cache: Cache MongoDB collection schemas and Delta Lake table schemas (TTL 5 minutes)
- Connection pooling: Reuse MongoDB and MinIO connections (min 5, max 50 per pool)
